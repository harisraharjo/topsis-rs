A [TOPSIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPSIS) implementation built with Rust.

Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution ([TOPSIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPSIS)) is a method for multi-criteria decision making. It compares a set of alternatives based on a pre-specified criterion. It allows trade-offs between criteria, where a poor result in one criterion can be negated by a good result in another criterion.
